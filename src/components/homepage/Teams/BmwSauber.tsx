          Sebastian Vettel made his first steps into the world of Formula 1 in
          2006 as a test and reserve driver for BMW Sauber. Even in his early
          days, the young German showcased remarkable talent and an insatiable
          hunger for speed. The 2007 season marked a turning point in Vettel's
          career. After Robert Kubica's dramatic crash at the Canadian Grand
          Prix, BMW Sauber entrusted Vettel with the driverâ€™s seat for the
          United States Grand Prix. Racing at Indianapolis, Vettel delivered an
          impressive performance, finishing 8th and scoring his first Formula 1
          point. At that time, he became the youngest driver ever to score a
          point in F1 history (a record later surpassed). His brief but
          impactful stint with BMW Sauber proved Vettel's potential to the
          motorsport world and paved the way for a full-time seat at Scuderia
          Toro Rosso later that season.
